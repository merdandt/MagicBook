  "summary": "The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic fantasy novel, The Lord of the Rings.  It tells the story of Frodo Baggins, a hobbit from the Shire, who inherits a powerful magic ring from his uncle, Bilbo. This ring, it turns out, is the One Ring, an artifact of immense power created by the Dark Lord Sauron to control all the other Rings of Power.  Gandalf the wizard reveals the ring's true nature and its danger to Middle-earth.  Frodo, accompanied by Samwise Gamgee, and later joined by Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took, sets out on a perilous journey to Rivendell, the home of Elrond the Half-elven, seeking guidance on what to do with the Ring.  They are pursued by Sauron's Ringwraiths, terrifying black riders who can sense the Ring's presence.  Along the way, they encounter various dangers and receive help from unexpected sources, including Tom Bombadil and the Elves of Lothl√≥rien.  At Rivendell, a council of Elves, Dwarves, and Men is held to decide the fate of the Ring. It is determined that the Ring must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom, the only place it can be unmade.  Frodo volunteers to be the Ring-bearer, and a Fellowship of nine companions is formed to aid him on his quest.  The Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, facing the daunting task of entering Mordor and confronting Sauron."
