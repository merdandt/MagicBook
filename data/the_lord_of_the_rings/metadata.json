  "summary": "The Lord of the Rings tells of the epic quest undertaken by Frodo Baggins and his companions to destroy the One Ring, an artifact of immense power forged by the Dark Lord Sauron.  Sauron seeks to regain the Ring, which would grant him dominion over Middle-earth.  Frodo, a hobbit from the Shire, inherits the Ring from his uncle Bilbo.  Guided by the wizard Gandalf, Frodo and a fellowship of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and men embark on a perilous journey to Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be unmade.  Along the way, they face numerous dangers, including orcs, trolls, Ringwraiths, and the treacherous creature Gollum, who craves the Ring for himself.  The Fellowship eventually breaks, and Frodo and his loyal companion Sam continue the quest alone, guided by the reluctant Gollum.  Meanwhile, Aragorn, the rightful heir to the throne of Gondor, emerges as a leader in the fight against Sauron's forces.  Epic battles are fought across Middle-earth, as the fate of the world hangs in the balance.  Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom, the volcano where the Ring was forged, but at the last moment, Frodo succumbs to the Ring's power and refuses to destroy it.  Gollum intervenes, biting off Frodo's finger and reclaiming the Ring, only to fall into the fiery chasm, destroying the Ring and vanquishing Sauron.  Aragorn is crowned king, and Middle-earth enters a new age of peace.  Frodo, deeply wounded by his ordeal, eventually sails to the Undying Lands with Bilbo and Gandalf, leaving Middle-earth behind."
