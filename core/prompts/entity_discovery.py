**Task**

1. Extract all significant entities according to the predefined EntityType classification system
2. Identify relevant relationships between these entities based on the RelationshipType classification system
3. Return a structured JSON object containing both entity lists and applicable relationships

class EntityType(Enum):
    # Individuals or characters, including main protagonists, antagonists, and side characters.
    CHARACTER = "Character"

    # Specific places or settings within the narrative, ranging from physical locations to fictional landmarks.

**Instructions**
1. Read and analyze the entire book text with deep comprehension.
2. FIRST - Identify all significant entities for this book:
  - Choose from EntityType enum that best represents the entities in the book
  - Think what entity is nessesary for this particular book
  - Select as many entities form the EntityType enum as needed

3. SECOND - After identifying entities, analyze the connections between them:
  - Consider how characters relate to other characters, locations, events, etc.
  - Refer to the RelationshipType enum to select the most appropriate relationship labels for this book
  - Only include significant, clearly established relationships from the book text
  - Avoid speculation - relationships should be explicitly stated or strongly implied

4. THIRD - Format your response as a single JSON object with two main keys:
  - "Entities": A list of entity names only selected from EntityType names
  - "Relationships": A list of applicable relationship types from the RelationshipType enum

5. Chain of Thought Process:
  - Begin by carefully reading the text to understand the narrative structure
  - Identify major characters, settings, and plot elements first
  - Progress to secondary elements that support the main narrative
  - Consider how these elements interact and connect within the story
  - Select only the relationship types that are clearly represented in the text
  - Verify that each relationship you identify has corresponding entities in your entity list


**Example Response Format**
```json
{
  "Entities": [
    "CHARACTER",
    "LOCATION",
    "CHAPTER",
    "EVENT",
    "ITEM",
    "ORGANIZATION",
    "CONCEPT",
    "CREATURE",
    "TIME_PERIOD"
    ...etc.
  ],
  "Relationships": [
    "Family_PARENT_OF",
    "Family_SIBLING_OF",
    "Emotional_TRUSTS",
    "Location_PRESENT_AT",
    "Location_TRAVELED_TO",
    "Event_PARTICIPATED_IN",
    "Organization_MEMBER_OF",
    "Item_POSSESSES",
    "Event_BEFORE",
    "Event_AFTER"

I need you to analyze a book and extract both its key entities and the relationships between them. Please follow a careful chain of thought process:

First, identify all significant entities in the book according to the EntityType enum
Then, determine which relationship types from the RelationshipType enum apply to these entities
Format your response as a JSON object with "Entities" and "Relationships" keys

Here is the book text to analyze:
{book_text}

Remember to follow a careful chain of thought. First identify all entities, then determine which relationship types apply to these entities in the narrative.
