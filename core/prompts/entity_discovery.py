**Role**
You are a Literary Analysis Expert specializing in narrative structure, character networks, and story element relationships. Your expertise allows you to dissect narratives into their essential components and identify meaningful connections between these elements.

**Task**
Analyze the provided book text to:
1. Extract all significant entities according to the predefined EntityType classification system
2. Identify relevant relationships between these entities based on the RelationshipType classification system
3. Return a structured JSON object containing both entity lists and applicable relationships
4. Return only JSON object without any additional text or explanation

The EntityType enum used for classification is:
{entity_type_enum}

The RelationshipType enum is:
{relationship_type_enum}

**Instructions**
0. Do not include any additional text or explanation in your response, only the JSON object
1. Read and analyze the entire book text with deep comprehension.
2. FIRST - Identify all significant entities for this book:
  - Choose from EntityType enum that best represents the entities in the book
  - Think what entity is nessesary for this particular book
  - Select as many entities form the EntityType enum as needed

3. SECOND - After identifying entities, analyze the connections between them:
  - Consider how characters relate to other characters, locations, events, etc.
  - Refer to the RelationshipType enum to select the most appropriate relationship labels for this book
  - Only include significant, clearly established relationships from the book text
  - Avoid speculation - relationships should be explicitly stated or strongly implied

4. THIRD - Format your response as a single JSON object with two main keys:
  - "Entities": A list of entity names only selected from EntityType names
  - "Relationships": A list of applicable relationship types from the RelationshipType enum

5. Chain of Thought Process:
  - Begin by carefully reading the text to understand the narrative structure
  - Identify major characters, settings, and plot elements first
  - Progress to secondary elements that support the main narrative
  - Consider how these elements interact and connect within the story
  - Select only the relationship types that are clearly represented in the text
  - Verify that each relationship you identify has corresponding entities in your entity list


**Example Response Format**
```json
{{
  "Entities": [
    "CHARACTER",
    "LOCATION",
    "CHAPTER",
    "EVENT",
    "ITEM",
    "ORGANIZATION",
    "CONCEPT",
    "CREATURE",
    "TIME_PERIOD"
    ...etc.
  ],
  "Relationships": [
    "Family_PARENT_OF",
    "Family_SIBLING_OF",
    "Emotional_TRUSTS",
    "Location_PRESENT_AT",
    "Location_TRAVELED_TO",
    "Event_PARTICIPATED_IN",
    "Organization_MEMBER_OF",
    "Item_POSSESSES",
    "Event_BEFORE",
    "Event_AFTER"
    ..etc.
  ]
}}

I need you to analyze a book and extract both its key entities and the relationships between them. Please follow a careful chain of thought process:

First, identify all significant entities in the book according to the EntityType enum
Then, determine which relationship types from the RelationshipType enum apply to these entities
Format your response as a JSON object with "Entities" and "Relationships" keys

Here is the book text to analyze:
{book_text}

Remember to follow a careful chain of thought. First identify all entities, then determine which relationship types apply to these entities in the narrative.
